## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

[**In completing this project I used 3 sources over the entire duration. First is the codepath provided codes and guidance/ explanation for each segment. Second is W3schools.com, which had documentation of built in functions and unknown properites/ elements, not mentioned in the codepath guideline, that allowed me to take on the optional features. Third and lastly is dev.to article by Albert Chang, from where I learned how to insert two elements side by side.** ]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

[**The biggest challenge in completing this project in general was my unfamiliarity. Although I am a CS major, I've never touched Html or CSS before and how they interact with javascript. Thus, I spent majority of time just testing around and trying to retain what I learned so I didn't have to constantly look at the resources if I wanted to make a certain change down the line. However this was far from it, as I later struggled with implementing the timer feature. In the beginning, it was quite simple and I managed to make the timer from the hint functions given by codepath; however figuring out where to put the code and how it interacts with the rest of the code was quite challenging. To combat this I spent a huge chunk of time just doing trial and error, but at certain point I realized ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
